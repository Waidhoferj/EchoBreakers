First and foremost, we care that people are respectful when they are discussing contentious issues. Secondly we would appreciate if you went into each conversation with an open mind, despite what preconceived notions you may have about the other person. Thirdly, no trolling, cyberbullying, or anything of the like. This community is based on respectful argumentation. Stick to proving the facts.", "By going past this point, you agree to these terms and conditions", "great to have you on board!
